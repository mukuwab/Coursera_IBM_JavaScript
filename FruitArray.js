//Array Indexing Practice

//Remeber that an array starts at index 0

//You have several fruits in a row on the shelf
let fruits = ["apple","banana","pineapple"];

//List the fruits in order

console.log("The fruits on the shelf are (in order):");

console.log("1st: "+fruits[0]);
console.log("2nd: "+fruits[1]);
console.log("3rd: "+fruits[2]);


//Now we want to add a new fruit. Use the PUSH method

fruits.push("cherry");
console.log("4th: "+fruits[3]);
